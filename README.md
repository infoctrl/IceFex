IceFex
======
IceFex is a symbolic-assisted fuzzing framework based on [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr). The input of IceFex are execution traces of binaries which parse input data like network packets, files and so on. <br>
Now IceFex is still under-development. In our plan, platform will be platform-neutral and os-neutral.
